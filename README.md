This is a simple Java-based desktop application that allows users to manage a personal library of TV shows.
Users can sign up or log in, add shows, rate them, and browse the collection through a user-friendly GUI built with Swing. 
Each show is rated using a star system and categorized based on average ratings.
The project includes:
- User authentication with file-based storage
- A GUI for login/signup and show management
- Show rating system with dynamic categorization (Amazing, Good, etc.)
- Persistent data storage using .txt files
